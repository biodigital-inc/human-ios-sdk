NOTE: You'll need to generate an API key in our developer site and put your credentials into the Sample Apps to view our 3D content.

NOTE: Our SDK uses a local loopback connection. By default, iOS enforces secure networking via App Transport Security (ATS), which blocks local HTTP traffic unless explicitly allowed. Please refer to the Info.plist in the sample apps for the required ATS configuration.

To test the Sample Apps, clone the repo or download the ZIP

Our Apple Research Kit integration is the file ORKBioDigitalModelManager.swift
